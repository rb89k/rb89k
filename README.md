### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

### Recent updates

- ðŸŽ‰Successfully received IDE approval.

While working with software engineers on a large, complex project in a highly regulated field, we pinpointed inter-component communication via messaging as a significant risk. The application's non-determinism, caused by timing variations and complexity, made comprehensive test automation difficult for these interactions. Therefore, we strategically focused manual testing efforts on validating the functionality of these high-risk communication pathways.
