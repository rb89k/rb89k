## Documentation and retrospectives ðŸ‘‹

<!-- TO-DO 
- Upload webrtc directory and test cases.
-->

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...  

- Peer-to-peer WebRTC application https://github.com/rb89k/p2pwebrtc/tree/main  
- using an ESCPOS receipt printer to output reminders, notes, tasks, etc. using the socat utility tool.

### Recent updates

- ðŸŽ‰ Successfully received IDE approval.

While working with software engineers on a large, complex project in a highly regulated field, we pinpointed inter-component communication via messaging as a significant risk. The application's non-determinism, caused by timing variations and complexity, made comprehensive test automation difficult for these interactions. Therefore, we strategically focused manual testing efforts on validating the functionality of these high-risk communication pathways.

#### Test Planning for Event-Driven Design

The approach to the pub-sub communication model was largely based on risk assessment with a focus on manual testing at the functional level 
due to the non-deterministic nature of the application. Efforts to automate tedious tasks such as verifying success/exit criterions occurred at the unit 
and integration level within the CI/CD pipeline.
